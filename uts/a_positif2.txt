Yes I'm over 40, male, and I cried. I've taken my kids to all 3 movies, and we've loved all of them. 
I must admit, I was nervous going in after watching the diabolical Wreck it Ralph 2. 
Was this 2nd sequel going to finish on a high? Absolutely, it didn't let me down. It had heart, it had a great story and an epic finish. 
Dreamworks, you've out done pixar on this one, well done!
