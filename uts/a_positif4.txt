How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is the third and final film in the trilogy, 
which in every way is the best of the 3, 
While taking a different tone the film itself feels more grown up along with its characters, 
this time around having a much more fleshed out world that seems lived in and 
real while also being an amazing character piece that deals with many heavier issues than is displayed in the trailers released, 
which should not be watched by ANYONE who doesn't want to know what happens before they see it. 
With a more thought out and thorough script and an amazing jump in visuals and 
story telling How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is a staple in animation while being a heartwarming and tear jerking send off to our beloved characters.
