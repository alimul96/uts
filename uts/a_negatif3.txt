I took my two kids to see this after thoroughly enjoying the first two movies and the TV series, but found this finale to be a little disappointing. it lacks the drama and suspense of the epic battle scenes with the huge impressive alpha dragons from the first two instalments, and the battle scenes are getting a little tired, with them able to avoid all projectiles while flying and/or escape after getting captured (again). it just doesn't feel like the characters or concept have developed much.

the focus on this instalments is more about developing love story, for Hiccup, Astrid and also for toothless. there are lots of feel good moments but it gets a little soppy towards the end. although looking at other reviews, it appeals to plenty of people.
