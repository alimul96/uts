What I can say is this the trailers don't do the movie justice. 
It's sad to see this awesome and wonderful journey come to a conclusion but it is the right time, 
It's both got heart and love yes most movies have love but this was more then just love. 
Don't let others decide the movie for you go watch it and see the amazing world of dragons and the hidden world you will not be disappointed
