Heck, this plot plays out extremely similarly to "Back to the Future 3". Love interest, bland villain who's a copy of a better one from the previous film (a more literal copy in that case), the danger of the plot device now suddenly too dangerous to be permitted to exist (Delorian too risky, dragons staying with humans too risky)the smashing of the first movie's plot device (literally having the Delorian hit by a train), and the pseudo-partings.

And if that were not enough, every other element of the film is a pale pastel puzzle of parts, many of which don't fit together well into the narrative flow.

It's exceedingly formulaic, to the point it hit EVERY SINGLE NOTE I and some writer pals were hoping it WOULD NOT lay out after we'd seen the trailers, given that they are THE MOST PREDICTABLE AND LAZY POSSIBLE OUTCOMES for those plot devices.

People are, as usual, allowing their 'feels' to run their brains, when just the slightest application of reason reveals this film's story is about equivalent to a typical fanfic which wouldn't pass muster in a college creative writing class.
