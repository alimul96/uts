Today I went and saw this movie, it intrigued me as to how the characters and plot/story could change. The animation in this film was gorgous, every scene detailed and perfected. It was sad to say but the story of this film was alittle too predictable. It might have been just me but it became obvious to how it was going to go. But it was cool to see a change in the direction where the story could stay interesting. Hiccups development over this film was perfect *spoilers* in my opinion he was able to learn how to be chief without the use of Toothless, so it was great that they included this. In my opinion, the comedy in this was ok at best. Final thoughts: would watch maybe one more time, good animation, ok story and character development
