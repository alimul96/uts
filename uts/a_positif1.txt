You need to watch this movie 20 times! 
It's the epic conclusion of one of the greatest stories ever! 
You will cry at the end for sure! I had some problems the first 20 minutes with the script, 
it took some time to connect with the audience. 
But still the movie was amazing! Was emotional and had memorable moments!!! 
Best Dreamworks movie, and one of the best animations I've seen!
